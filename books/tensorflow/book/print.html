<p>Welcome to <em>Machine Learning with TensorFlow</em>, an easy to follow book / blog about understanding machine learning concepts, and their implementation in <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow</a>. My goal is to create an <strong>intuitive</strong> explanation of machine learning methods, paired with practical knowledge of implementation with TensorFlow. This books does assume some small working knowledge of programming, but Python specific syntax will be briefly introduced as needed.  In addition, some mathematics background will be useful, in particular linear algebra and calculus, but is not needed to follow the intuition and implementation. Resources to review relevant math concepts will be provided as required.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what-exactly-is-machine-learning" id="what-exactly-is-machine-learning"><h2>What exactly is machine learning?</h2></a>
<p>Though the exact definition is up for debate, roughly &quot;Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed&quot; (Wikipedia). Traditionally, programming has been used to great effect to solve problems which have explicit steps. For example, consider the problem of determing if a number \(n\) is prime. We can easily determine if \(n\) is prime using fairly simple steps: check if \(n\) is divisible by \(2\), check if \(n\) is divisible by \(3\), \(\cdots\), check if \(n\) is divisible by \(n-1\). If \(n\) is divisible by any of these, then \(n\) is not prime, and otherwise it is prime. With traditional programming we then need to write these specific steps (an <strong>algorithm</strong>) in a programming language that our computer can interpret, and we have a working program which can classify numbers as prime much faster than a human ever could.</p>
<p>However, some tasks seem difficult or impossible to solve using specific steps like above. Rather than classifying prime numbers, let us instead try to classify images of faces as male or female in appearance.</p>
<p><img src="/books/tensorflow/book/ch1-setup/lenna.png" alt="Female Image" /></p>
<p>Most people would easily identify the image above as female in appearance. But, can you explain <strong>how</strong> you came to this conclusion, in very specific steps? Perhaps, one might say that the hair seems female, but then one would need to explain how to determine that the hair seems female. Black colored pixels do not suffice: plenty of males also have black hair. Maybe, the shape of facial features such as lips are useful for determing female appearance, but it still seems nearly impossible to describe a precise algorithm that uses this data.</p>
<p>Qualitatively, humans do not seem to comprehend the apparent gender of a face by performing some precise algorithm, and this suggests that a computer program to solve this problem should not either. By using machine learning, we can use data to help the computer to learn to recognize a male or female face, without explicitely programming it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#so-what-is-tensorflow-and-why-do-we-need-it" id="so-what-is-tensorflow-and-why-do-we-need-it"><h2>So, what is TensorFlow, and why do we need it?</h2></a>
<p>Without diving into the details of various machine learning methods, I'll generally state that there <strong>could</strong> be a fairly significant amount of math involved. Not necessarily super difficult math, but some pretty cumbersome math. Roughly, TensorFlow takes care of the calculus grunt work for us: instead of spending a ton of time finding messy derivatives and many lines of code to compute them, TensorFlow lets us focus on the fairly elegant work of defining our machine learning methods, and the more important math necessary to obtain intuition.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, we can get started by installing Python, TensorFlow, and a few other useful tools. Just follow the appropriate directions for your operating system.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#macos-setup" id="macos-setup"><h1>macOS Setup</h1></a>
<p>Without a doubt, Python 3 is the future of Python, and thus we will use Python 3 with TensorFlow. While I summarize the instructions to install TensorFlow with Python 3 here, the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac">official TensorFlow documentation</a> should always provide up-to-date and comprehensive instructions for installation as well. If you run into any installation problems, please file a bug <a href="https://github.com/donald-pinckney/donald-pinckney.github.io/issues/new?labels=Installation%20problem,TensorFlow">here</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#installing-python-3" id="installing-python-3"><h2>Installing Python 3</h2></a>
<p>macOS does not come installed with Python 3 (only Python 2.7), so we need to install it ourselves. The first step is to open terminal (Terminal.app on your Mac), and install the <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> package manager for macOS, if you haven't already installed it before. Just paste the appropriate command into terminal, and follow Homebrew's installation prompts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># For bash, ksh, zsh, csh, and other shells:
/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
# For fish shell:
/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now that Homebrew is installed, we need to install Python 3:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">brew install python3
</code></pre>
<p>You can test that <code>python3</code> installed correctly by running the command <code>python3</code>. You should see output similar to:</p>
<pre><code>~ $ python3
Python 3.6.3 (default, Nov 20 2017, 14:17:35) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.38)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The Python version should be 3.x.y instead of 2.x.y.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#installing-tensorflow-and-friends" id="installing-tensorflow-and-friends"><h2>Installing TensorFlow and friends</h2></a>
<p>Installing Python 3 (<code>python3</code>) also installs the Python 3 package manager (<code>pip3</code>). We can use <code>pip3</code> to install a Python utility called <code>virtualenv</code>. Virtualenv is an extremely easy and convenient way to install Python packages in a local and contained manner. The recommended way to install TensorFlow is by using <code>virtualenv</code>, since this ensures that the installation will be self-contained, and will not affect the rest of your system. So, first we need to install <code>virtualenv</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
</code></pre>
<p>Now, create a new virtualenv:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># In this command, ~/tensorflow is the destination directory where the virtualenv will be created. 
# You can choose a different location if you prefer, but the rest of the installation tutorial will assume ~/tensorflow
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ~/tensorflow
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we need to <em>activate</em> the virtualenv so we can install things inside it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate # If using bash, sh, ksh, zsh
source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate.csh # If using csh or tcsh
source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate.fish # If using fish
</code></pre>
<p>After activating the virtualenv, your command prompt should change to look like: <code>(tensorflow)$</code>. At this point, we are finally ready to install TensorFlow:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow 
</code></pre>
<p>In addition, we also install a few other Python packages that are useful for machine learning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip3 install --upgrade numpy # Used for linear algebra. Essential for using TensorFlow 
pip3 install --upgrade matplotlib # Used for plotting data, which is very useful for machine learning
pip3 install --upgrade pandas # Used for loading datasets
</code></pre>
<p>Once everything is installed, you can exit the virtualenv using the command <code>deactivate</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#testing-the-installation" id="testing-the-installation"><h2>Testing the installation</h2></a>
<p>Let's just quickly test the installation, to verify everything is installed and ready to go! If it isn't currently activated, activate your virtualenv with the appropriate activate command from above. Then, run the <code>python</code> command, and type the following code into Python:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello))
</code></pre>
<p>If everything is installed correctly, you should see the output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello, TensorFlow!
</code></pre>
<p>If the above test produces errors, please see this list of <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac#common_installation_problems">common TensorFlow installation problems</a> or Google it, and file a bug <a href="https://github.com/donald-pinckney/donald-pinckney.github.io/issues/new?labels=Installation%20problem,Duplicate&amp;title=Installation%20error%20on%20macOS">here</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#optional-installing-an-ide" id="optional-installing-an-ide"><h2>Optional: Installing an IDE</h2></a>
<p>At this point, everything we need for writing TensorFlow code is installed. We can write our Python code in a text editor of our choice, and run it using <code>python</code> from terminal. In the future I won't assume use of an IDE specifically, but rather assume that you can create new Python files and run them, either from terminal or an IDE. However, some people may prefer using an IDE, which can reduce the time spent in Terminal, and help provide better syntax and semantic checking of Python code. Personally, I use and recommend PyCharm, which you can download for free <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac">here</a>. I won't provide specific installation instructions, but I found it very easy to install and configure to use the <code>~/tensorflow</code> virtualenv.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#optional-install-gpu-support" id="optional-install-gpu-support"><h2>Optional: Install GPU Support</h2></a>
<p>On Linux TensorFlow has the ability to run your machine learning models on a GPU, which can make computation significantly faster. However, the speed difference is negligible until we start building extremely large models with massive amounts of data. So if you have a supported GPU, you could choose to install GPU support now, or just wait until later. To see if your GPU is supported and instructions for installing GPU support, see <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#nvidia_requirements_to_run_tensorflow_with_gpu_support">here</a>.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#linear-regression" id="linear-regression"><h1>Linear Regression</h1></a>
<p>Roughly, there are two categories of machine learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>In <em>supervised learning</em> one already has access to a data set of example inputs and desired outputs, and teaches the computer to produce the desired outputs given the example inputs.</li>
<li>In <em>unsupervised learning</em> one only has access to a data set: there is not necessarily any notion of &quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot;. The goal is to teach the computer to autonmously discover underlying patterns in the data set.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if we have a data set containg students' GPAs and SAT scores, we could attempt to train a supervised machine learning model to predice SAT scores given GPAs. Here, GPA would be the input, and SAT score would be the desired output. On the other hand, if we only have access to students' GPAs, then we could try to use unsupervised machine learning models to find patterns in the GPAs: perhaps there exist &quot;clusters&quot; in the data of similarly performing students.</p>
<p>Unsupervised machine learning will be touched on later, but for now we focus on supervised machine learning: in general it is easier, and the objective is clearer.  Specifically, there are two main types of supervised learning:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Regression</em> aims to predict a continuous output, given the inputs.</li>
<li><em>Classification</em> aims to predict a classification, given the inputs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GPA and SAT score example from above is an example of regression, since we are trying to predict the continuous output variable of SAT scores. We aren't trying to classify students based on GPAs, we just want to estimate what their SAT score will be. On the other hand, suppose we also have data about UC Davis college admissions: we could then try to predict whether or not a student will be accepted based on their GPA. This would be an example of classification, since the output of the prediction is not continuous, it is a classification (accepted or rejected).</p>
<p>In this chapter we look at regression only, and specifically the simplest form: linear regression. We start with the most basic form of linear regression (single variable linear regression), and then move on to consider variants of linear regression. Using these variants we can obtain models that are both fairly simple and powerful.</p>
