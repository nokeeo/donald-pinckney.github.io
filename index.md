title: About Me
---

I'm a 1st year computer science PhD student at UMass Amherst, studying programming languages. Previously, I studied Math and Computer Science at UC Davis. In addition to programming languages research, I enjoy studying machine learning, computer vision, abstract algebra and topology.

Outside of school I enjoy practicing martial arts (in particular Tai Chi, Wing Chun, and Taekwondo), playing music, and of course coding.
