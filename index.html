<h1 id="interests" class="post-title titular">Research Interests</h1>

<p>
    My research interests center around programming languages and software engineering.
    In my work I look to provide formal guarantees of program properties in a way that is meaningful for real-world application.

        <strong>Serverless Computing:</strong> My most recent (and first) research project at UMass Amherst 
        <a href="https://plasma-umass.org">PLASMA lab</a> was to tackle some fundamental problems with serverless computing (e.g. AWS Lambda). 
        Serverless functions are super exciting, but they pose some challenges with regards to concurrency and composability.
        In particular, the underlying cloud platform (such as AWS Lambda) can perform quite complicated patterns of 
        reusing and restarting of the containers inside which code is run.
        This <em>should</em> be unnoticeable to programmers using the platform, but unfortunately may not be, 
        especially when the serverless functions involve shared data storage. In our work we provide formal proofs specifying under what 
        conditions the underlying mechanics of the serverless platform are indeed abstracted away from programmers. 
        In addition, we improve the situation of composing serverless functions by providing a language based on 
        <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/afp-arrows.pdf" target="_blank">Arrows</a>, which can be used to specify pipelines of serverless functions.
        A draft of the paper is <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/public/files/documents/foundations.pdf" target="_blank">available here</a>.

<h1 id="bio" class="clickable-header top-level-header">About Me</h1>

<p>
    Currently, I'm a {{ site.school_year }} year computer science PhD student at UMass Amherst, 
    where I study programming languages and software engineering. I'm advised by
        <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~arjun/home/" target="_blank">Arjun Guha</a> and
        <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/" target="_blank">Yuriy Brun</a>, and a member of the 
        <a href="https://plasma-umass.org" target="_blank">PLASMA</a> and 
        <a href="http://laser.cs.umass.edu" target="_blank">LASER</a> labs. 
</p>

<p>
    However, I'm relatively new to Massachusetts, as I grew up for most of my life in California. 
    For my undergraduate degree, I completed a double major in Math and Computer Science at UC Davis. 
    Meanwhile, I interned in industry for 3 summers, once at 
        <a href="https://www.filemaker.com" target="_blank">FileMaker</a>, and twice at Apple, where I worked on the 
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit" target="_blank">AppKit user interface library</a> for macOS.
    After interning in industry I decided to pursue a PhD in computer science, and specifically programming languages, 
    so I can work to drive the field forward in creating correct, safe, and secure software more easily.

<p>
    In addition to programming languages research, I enjoy dabbling in machine learning, as well as abstract algebra and topology on the pure math side. 
    Outside of academics I enjoy practicing martial arts (in particular Tai Chi, Wing Chun, and Taekwondo), playing music, and archery.
    I also love to travel with my amazing girlfriend 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jingwen-lin-b0b1ba152/" target="_blank">Jingwen Lin</a> 
    (a masters student in Food Science at UMass) to see awesome sights. 
    Recently, we travelled all over China, seeing all sorts of both historic and scenic views, such as 玉龙雪山 
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Dragon_Snow_Mountain" target="_blank">Jade Dragon Snow Mountain</a>) pictured at right.
    I would like to thank her and my mother Jane, who have and continue to support me to be the best I can be, and make my life truly wonderful
