## What is Metal, and why use it?
[Metal][metal website] is a powerful new GPU programming API designed by Apple. Originally it was announced in 2014 for iOS and claimed significant performance benefits over [OpenGL][opengl website], the standard 3D graphics API, and since 2014 it has gained the ability for general purpose GPU computation, cross-platform support between iOS and macOS, and other features. But what exactly is it, and how does it compare to OpenGL?

Both Metal and OpenGL are low-level APIs that provide programmable access to GPU hardware for 3D graphics. Both allow you to write code that will execute on the GPU to customize how 3D objects are rendered. However, OpenGL tends to hide the communication between the CPU and the GPU, whereas Metal requires you to explicitly program this communication. 

This gives us two advantages: first, it allows for greater efficiency in terms of CPU and GPU communication; and second it provides an excellent learning opportunity to understand how this low-level communication works. But don't let this scare you: while this might sound horribly complicated, but actually it's quite elegant and enjoyable code to write.

Finally, a quick note about what this tutorial is and what it isn't: it is meant to give a brief introduction to the very basics of rendering with Metal, with little or no prior knowledge required about Swift or 3D graphics. Later tutorials will build on this by looking at programming interesting 3D effects in Metal. However, if your goal is to get started quickly with game development, learning Metal is probably not the fastest way to make a game; instead you should look at higher-level game engines, such as [Unity][unity website] or others.

## Rough Sketch of Graphics Pipelines
3D graphics are generally described by geometry, which is usually specified by the **vertices** of triangles. These vertices are generated by code on the CPU, and then need to be sent over to the GPU for rendering. The vertex data will then be fed through a GPU pipeline, eventually resulting in a final image being rendered, which can then be displayed on screen:

![Basic GPU Pipeline][basic_pipeline]

In short, a **pipeline** is a series of pre-configured steps that the GPU hardware takes to turn a bunch of vertex data into a final rendered image. Modern 3D graphics requires being able to program exactly what happens inside of the pipeline, and describing the pipeline via code is the central concept in Metal programming. Programming a simple pipeline that can render a single 2D triangle is the goal of this tutorial, and as we go through the code we will break this abstract pipeline into detailed individual components.

## Hello, Triangle!

Rendering a 2D multi-colored triangle is the hello world program for graphics, and is the goal for this post. We will develop specifically for macOS since it is most convenient, but the code will actually be cross-platform with iOS and tvOS. To visualize the end goal, a screenshot of it looks like this:

![End Goal Screenshot][screen1]

### Creating a one window macOS app
Open Xcode (make sure to install the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store), make a new Xcode project, choose "Cocoa App" under "macOS", and hit next. Then, fill in whatever you want for the Product Name (I'll use `MetalIntro1`), choose Swift for the language, make sure Use Storyboards is checked, and Create Document-Based Application is *not* checked. My settings look like this:

![Project Settings][xcode1]

Then, hit Next, and save it somewhere. If you run the app (&#8984;R) then a single blank window should appear. This blank window is where we want to display our 3D graphics. Before we can write actual Metal code, we need a way for the 3D graphics to even appear in our window.

### Setting Up a MetalKit View
Everything visual in `macOS` is represented by a *view*, which concretely is a subclass of `NSView`. We need a view in our window in which we can display the results of the Metal graphics rendering. Apple provides a prebuilt view just for this purpose, `MTKView`, which we will take advantage of.

First, we need to add a `MTKView` to the window by modifying the Storyboard file, and then we need to configure it via code. Open `Main.storyboard`, select the root view of the view controller, and in the inspector panel change the class from `NSView` to `MTKView`, as shown below.

![Modifying the Storyboard][xcode2]

Now to configure the `MTKView` we need to write some initialization code in the view controller, so open `ViewController.swift`. We will need access to the Metal framework, and the auxiliary MetalKit framework, so add these imports at the top:

```swift
import Metal
import MetalKit
```
 
First we want to save the `MTKView` in a convenient variable, so add the following instance variable to the view controller class:

```swift
var mtkView: MTKView!
```

To initialize this variable in the `viewDidLoad` function add this code to the `viewDidLoad` function, after the `super.viewDidLoad()` call:

```swift
guard let mtkViewTemp = self.view as? MTKView else {
    print("View attached to ViewController is not an MTKView!")
    return
}
mtkView = mtkViewTemp
```

Now we can configure `mtkView`. The two necessary properties to configure are the `device` and the `delegate`. The device is easiest, so we will do it first. The `device` (of type `MTLDevice`) represents the actual GPU hardware. We can retrieve the default GPU and save it to the `mtkView` like so:

```swift
guard let defaultDevice = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() else {
    print("Metal is not supported on this device")
    return
}

print("My GPU is: \(defaultDevice)")
mtkView.device = defaultDevice
```

If you run the app now, it should print in the Xcode console what your GPU is, but nothing will be rendered inside the window, since we haven’t told Metal to do any rendering. To set this up we need to configure the `delegate` property of the `mtkView`. The `delegate`is an independent object which is responsible for performing our custom rendering, whenever the `mtkView` asks it to. The great thing about this approach is that it is easy to write platform independent code: our view controller code is specific to macOS, but it is very short; the meat of the code will live inside the object we assign to the `delegate`property.

So we need to make a new `class` who’s responsibility is to render our custom graphics whenever `mtkView` asks it to. To do so it just needs to implement the `MTKViewDelegate` protocol. Let’s make a new Swift file called `Renderer.swift`, and add the code below to declare a new `Renderer` class (and import the needed frameworks):

```swift
import Metal
import MetalKit

class Renderer : NSObject, MTKViewDelegate {

    // This is the initializer for the Renderer class.
    // We will need access to the mtkView later, so we add it as a parameter here.
    init?(mtkView: MTKView) {

    }

    // mtkView will automatically call this function
    // whenever it wants new content to be rendered.
    func draw(in view: MTKView) {
        
    }

    // mtkView will automatically call this function
    // whenever the size of the view changes (such as resizing the window).
    func mtkView(_ view: MTKView, drawableSizeWillChange size: CGSize) {
        
    }
}
```

This class includes an initializer (with an `MTKView` as a parameter), and the two required functions for implementing the `MTKViewDelegate` protocol. We will come back to filling in the `draw(in view: MTKView)` function later, but first we will finish writing all of the code for `ViewController.swift`. 

Now that we have this skeleton class, we can create an instance in the `viewDidLoad` function and configure `mtkView` with it. First, we add an instance variable for it to the `ViewController` class:

```swift
var renderer: Renderer!
```

At the end of the `viewDidLoad` function we create an instance of the `Renderer` class, and configure the `delegate` property:

```swift
guard let tempRenderer = Renderer(mtkView: mtkView) else {
    print("Renderer failed to initialize")
    return
}
renderer = tempRenderer
        
mtkView.delegate = renderer
```

At this point we are completely done with the setup code, and now we can move on to actual Metal code. For reference, here is my final version of `ViewController.swift`:

```swift
import Cocoa
import Metal
import MetalKit

class ViewController: NSViewController {

    var mtkView: MTKView!
    var renderer: Renderer!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // First we save the MTKView to a convenient instance variable
        guard let mtkViewTemp = self.view as? MTKView else {
            print("View attached to ViewController is not an MTKView!")
            return
        }
        mtkView = mtkViewTemp
        
        // Then we create the default device, and configure mtkView with it
        guard let defaultDevice = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() else {
            print("Metal is not supported on this device")
            return
        }
        
        print("My GPU is: \(defaultDevice)")
        mtkView.device = defaultDevice
        
        // Lastly we create an instance of our Renderer object, 
        // and set it as the delegate of mtkView
        guard let tempRenderer = Renderer(mtkView: mtkView) else {
            print("Renderer failed to initialize")
            return
        }
        renderer = tempRenderer
                
        mtkView.delegate = renderer
    }
}
```

### Clearing the Screen by Issuing GPU Commands

We have everything setup for us to start writing graphics code in `Renderer.swift`. Before we draw a triangle, we will start with clearing the screen, which will involve issuing commands to GPU, and transferring the results back to the `mtkView`.

Metal requires us to keep track of a queue (essentially a list) of commands that are waiting to be executed on the GPU. A Metal command queue is represented by the class `MTLCommandQueue`, and commands are represented by the class `MTLCommandBuffer`. This is an outline of what we need to do to have a full render pass working:

1. At initialization time, create one `MTLCommandQueue` (call it `commandQueue`).
2. At each draw cycle, create a `MTLCommandBuffer`, configure it to include the draw commands we want, and then add it to `commandQueue`
3. Once the `MTLCommandBuffer` finishes executing on the GPU, we need to display the results in the `mtkView`.

Let's start with the first task. We need to keep track of one `MTLCommandQueue` for the whole `Renderer` class. For convenience we also want to keep track of the `MTLDevice`, since we will use it a lot later. So, add the following instance variables to the `Renderer` class:

```swift
let device: MTLDevice
let commandQueue: MTLCommandQueue
```

Now, inside the intializer (the `init?` function) add the following code to setup these variables:

```swift
device = mtkView.device!

commandQueue = device.makeCommandQueue()!
```

Note that we have to use the `device` to create a new command queue: this means that a command queue is associated with a specific device, and can only be used with that device.

We have now initialized a command queue, so now in the `draw(in view: MTKView)` we can create a `MTLCommandBuffer`, configure it, and add it to the queue. In the `draw(in view: MTKView)` function the first thing we do is create a new `MTLCommandBuffer`:

```swift
// Get an available command buffer
guard let commandBuffer = commandQueue.makeCommandBuffer() else { return }
```

Now, we need to configure `commandBuffer` to perform drawing commands that we want. First, we use a `MTLRenderPassDescriptor` to configure some options about input and output. *When that is finalized*, we then use a `MTLRenderCommandEncoder` to configure what drawing operations the GPU will perform.

There are a lot of options to configure for the `MTLRenderPassDescriptor`. Fortunately, the `MTKView` provides us with a pre-configured `MTLRenderPassDescriptor`, so we can just grab that and then change the default options:

```swift
// Get the default MTLRenderPassDescriptor from the MTKView argument
guard let renderPassDescriptor = view.currentRenderPassDescriptor else { return }

// Change default settings. For example, we change the clear color from black to red.
renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].clearColor = MTLClearColorMake(1, 0, 0, 1)
```

More configure options on a `MTLRenderPassDescriptor` will be discussed in future posts, but for now the most important option is the `colorAttachments` array. The first (and for now only) item in the `colorAttachments` array describes the output destination of the rendering. In this case, setting the `clearColor` property to `(1, 0, 0, 1)` (these are RGBA values) tells Metal to clear the color attachment to a value of `(1, 0, 0, 1)` before rendering. Other notable properties that the `MTKView` set for us include `renderTargetWidth` and `renderTargetHeight`, which were automatically set to the size of the `MTKView`.

This is all that we need to do to configure `renderPassDescriptor`. We now finalize it by converting it into a `MTLRenderCommandEncoder`:

```swift
// We compile renderPassDescriptor to a MTLRenderCommandEncoder.
guard let renderEncoder = commandBuffer.makeRenderCommandEncoder(descriptor: renderPassDescriptor) else { return }  
```

At this point we would use `renderEncoder` to encode various drawing commands to tell the GPU to draw triangles based on vertex data. For now we just want to clear the screen, so we don't need to encode any drawing commands.

Since we are done encoding our drawing commands (none of them), we finish the encoding process:

```swift
// This finalizes the encoding of drawing commands.
renderEncoder.endEncoding()
```

At this point, `commandBuffer` as been configured via `renderPassDescriptor` and `renderEncoder` to describe a bunch of GPU commands for an entire render pass. The `commandBuffer` includes rendering output information, such as output width and height, the clear color, and other properties, as well as a (currently empty) list of encoded drawing commands. However, *calling `endEncoding()` does NOT send this information to the GPU yet!* This gives us control about when to actually trigger expensive drawing commands on the GPU, vs. just finish encoding them.

We are now ready to send the encoded commands to the GPU. However, it is crucial to understand that the CPU and GPU work asynchronously: so when we send the encoded commands to the GPU, it will work on completing them while the CPU code continues to run, and then finish the commands and obtain the color image result at some indeterminate point in the future. But, we need a way to know when the rendering finishes and at that time place the result into the `MTKView`. If we don't do this, the GPU will finish rendering, and then the result will simply disappear, since the CPU doesn't even know about the result.

Setting up the callback to place it into the `MTKView` is very easy, since `MTKView` actually provides most of the implementation for us. We just need to tell the `commandBuffer` to present into the `MTKView`'s drawable:

```swift
// Tell Metal to send the rendering result to the MTKView when rendering completes
commandBuffer.present(view.currentDrawable)
```

A drawable is simply a resource managed by the `MTKView` which Metal can write the result into.

Now, we are finally ready to send the encoded command buffer to the GPU. This is just one of line code:

```swift
// Finally, send the encoded command buffer to the GPU.
commandBuffer.commit()
```

> Note that `commandBuffer.commit()` is a bit more nuanced than just sending the command buffer to the GPU. Since `commandBuffer` is actually stored in `commandQueue`, writing `commandBuffer.commit()` will prepare it for execution on the GPU, at the back of the queue. So other command buffers that are ahead of it in line (that were committed first) will execute first.

Running the code now should look like this:

![Clear Red Screen][screen2]

And for reference the current code in `Renderer.swift` is:

```swift
import Foundation
import Metal
import MetalKit

class Renderer : NSObject, MTKViewDelegate {
    
    let device: MTLDevice
    let commandQueue: MTLCommandQueue
    
    // This is the initializer for the Renderer class.
    // We will need access to the mtkView later, so we add it as a parameter here.
    init?(mtkView: MTKView) {
        device = mtkView.device!
        
        commandQueue = device.makeCommandQueue()!
    }
    
    // mtkView will automatically call this function
    // whenever it wants new content to be rendered.
    func draw(in view: MTKView) {
        // Get an available command buffer
        guard let commandBuffer = commandQueue.makeCommandBuffer() else { return }
        
        // Get the default MTLRenderPassDescriptor from the MTKView argument
        guard let renderPassDescriptor = view.currentRenderPassDescriptor else { return }
        
        // Change default settings. For example, we change the clear color from black to red.
        renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].clearColor = MTLClearColorMake(1, 0, 0, 1)
        
        // We compile renderPassDescriptor to a MTLRenderCommandEncoder.
        guard let renderEncoder = commandBuffer.makeRenderCommandEncoder(descriptor: renderPassDescriptor) else { return }
        
        // TODO: Here is where we need to encode drawing commands!
        
        // This finalizes the encoding of drawing commands.
        renderEncoder.endEncoding()
        
        // Tell Metal to send the rendering result to the MTKView when rendering completes
        commandBuffer.present(view.currentDrawable!)
        
        // Finally, send the encoded command buffer to the GPU.
        commandBuffer.commit()
    }
    
    // mtkView will automatically call this function
    // whenever the size of the view changes (such as resizing the window).
    func mtkView(_ view: MTKView, drawableSizeWillChange size: CGSize) {
        
    }
}
