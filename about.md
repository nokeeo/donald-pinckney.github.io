I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student at UC Davis, studying Math and Computer Science. In particular, I enjoy studying machine learning, computer vision, programming languages, and abstract algebra.

Outside of school I enjoy practicing martial arts (in particular Tai Chi, Wing Chun, and Taekwondo), playing music, and of course coding.
